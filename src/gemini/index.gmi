# Timo Tiuraniemi
## Hi, I'm Timo
I'm a husband and father. My craft is programming, but I have a background in philosophy.

I'm currently a full-time activist fighting for the commons. I do that by building the digital commons with free and open source software, and by protecting the environmental commons with demands for climate justice and degrowth.
